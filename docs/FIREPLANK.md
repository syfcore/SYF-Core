# FirePlank™ — Systemic Safety Floor

**Layer**: SYF Core  
**Status**: Canonical · v0.1-docs

## 1. Definition

FirePlank™ is a mathematical continuity constraint that ensures R never falls below a defined minimum, preserving minimal systemic coherence even under total noise.

## 2. Core Properties

- **Not a reserve** — no value is stored or controlled  
- **Not a recovery mechanism** — no state is restored  
- **Not bypassable** — cannot be disabled or tuned  
- **No beneficiary** — introduces no reward, mint, or inflation  
- **No external trigger** — operates purely from internal state

## 3. What FirePlank™ Is NOT

- Not a "Phoenix mint"  
- Not an on-chain contract  
- Not auditable via transaction history  
- Not a financial safety net

> FirePlank™ is a **thermodynamic floor**, not a monetary policy.
