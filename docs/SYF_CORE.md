1. Definition
SYF Core is the minimal executable body required to instantiate the
Systemic Foundation law in a real system.
SYF Core is not an application.
SYF Core is not a framework.
SYF Core is not an operating system.
SYF Core is a law-bearing core, conceptually equivalent to a kernel,
without being tied to any operating system.
If the core is removed, the law cannot be executed.
If everything else is removed, the law must remain valid.

2. Core Scope
SYF Core contains only what is strictly necessary to express and preserve
the law.
Anything optional, contextual, interpretive, or usage-oriented is
explicitly excluded.

3. Canonical Components of SYF Core
SYF Core is composed of the following four and only four elements.

3.1 SyFF — Systemic Fire Formula
Role: Fundamental law
Pure mathematical formulation
Deterministic
No parameters exposed to human control
No external dependencies
SyFF defines how unstable input is transformed into a stable ratio.
SyFF remains valid even if never executed.

3.2 R — Systemic Ratio
Role: Core state output
Single scalar invariant
No semantic meaning (not "good", not "bad")
No direct causality
No action binding
R is an observable state, not a command.

3.3 FirePlank™ — Systemic Safety Floor
Role: Core continuity constraint
Prevents total systemic extinction
Introduces no inflation
Has no beneficiary
Cannot be bypassed, disabled, or tuned
FirePlank™ is not a recovery mechanism.
It is a continuity constraint intrinsic to the law.

3.4 Core Axioms (Non-Negotiable)
These axioms are part of the core and have the same authority as SyFF.
- No governance
- No oracle
- No feedback loops
- No human parameters
- No overrides
- No intent
If any of these are violated, the implementation is not SYF Core.

4. What SYF Core Is NOT
The following are explicitly outside the core boundary:
- Dizer
- Inoculum NP
- Chimera-Breaker
- FrameR
- SEW
- CoreXalt
- WMW
- WAX
- Logs, formats, encodings
- Dashboards, pipelines, services

These are derived systems that may use SYF Core, but are not part of it.
If a component can be removed without invalidating the law,
it does not belong to the core.

5. Core / System Boundary
The boundary is absolute.
- SYF Core does not import derived systems
- Derived systems may import SYF Core
- No upward dependency is allowed
This separation is structural, not organizational.

6. Open Source Rationale
SYF Core is open source because it embodies a law, not a product.
- Laws must be verifiable
- Core mechanisms must be auditable
- Invariants must be reproducible
Open source does not imply:
- support
- roadmap
- feature development
- governance

7. Invariance Requirement
A valid SYF Core implementation must satisfy:
- Removing all derived systems does not break the law
- Independent implementations yield compatible R behavior
- FirePlank™ behavior cannot be externally triggered or suppressed
If an implementation requires surrounding systems to function,
the implementation is invalid.

8. Canonical Statement
SYF Core is a minimal law-bearing core.
Systems may evolve.
The core must not.
