# Core Axioms of SYF

These axioms are non-negotiable and have the same authority as SyFF.

- **No governance**: No voting, no admin, no override
- **No oracle**: No external input required
- **No feedback**: No loop from output to input
- **No human parameters**: No tunable knobs
- **No intent**: No goal, no optimization
- **No recovery**: Failure is valid; no restart path

If any axiom is violated, the system is not SYF Core.
